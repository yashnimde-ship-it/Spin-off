# Phase 4 API Contracts — v1.5

Source of truth for the frontend. Schemas here are fixed; if implementation
forces a change, the change is raised before it is made, not after.

**v1.5 changes from v1.4:** clarified that `/dashboard/summary`'s `degraded`
field is always present. Documentation only - no behaviour change.

**v1.4 changes from v1.3:** heatmap cold SLA relaxed 30 s -> 45 s to match
measured 38 s; warming documented as asynchronous; API version 0.2.

**v1.3 changes from v1.2:** corrected `counts.with_generic_fleet_only` from
3 to 4 — Dongri Buzurg was missing from the count — and added it to the
`is_generic_fallback` list. Value change only, no shape change.

**v1.2 changes from v1.1:** four-state cell rendering guide on
`/prospectivity/heatmap`; three warm viewports named from
`settings.HEATMAP_WARM_VIEWPORTS`; prospectivity model promoted v1 -> v6, so
`model_version` now reads `prospectivity_v6`.

**v1.1 changes from v1.0:** `coverage` scoping note on `/production/history`;
`top_features` renamed to `feature_contributions` and now returns all nine;
`feature_provenance` keyed by concern; `/mines` counts gained
`with_capacity_target` and `with_generic_fleet_only`; new
`GET /prospectivity/heatmap` (section 10).

Base URL (local dev): `http://127.0.0.1:8000`

## Conventions

**Validation errors are always `422`**, using FastAPI's native error body. There
is no `400`: a well-formed request carrying invalid contents is Unprocessable
Entity, and one shape means the frontend needs one handler.

```json
{
  "detail": [
    {
      "type": "value_error",
      "loc": ["query", "horizon"],
      "msg": "horizon must be one of 1, 3, 6, 12",
      "input": "7"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Server-side failures return `500`** with a flat body carrying a machine
-readable code:

```json
{
  "error_code": "model_not_loaded",
  "detail": "prophet_baseline_v1_0_shipped.pkl not found in models/",
  "remedy": "run python -m src.models.forecast.prophet_baseline --variant vanilla, then promote the artifact"
}
```

Error codes: `model_not_loaded`, `data_not_loaded`, `prediction_failed`.

**An empty result is `200`, never an error.** A date filter matching no months
returns `series: []` with `coverage.months_present: 0`.

**Months are `YYYY-MM` strings** throughout. Tonnages are floats in tonnes.

### Model path split

Endpoints read frozen, promoted artifacts. Training writes elsewhere, and
promotion is a manual copy. This exists because the 3.2c rainfall run
overwrote `prophet_baseline_v1.pkl` and the API silently served the rejected
variant while returning `200`.

| purpose | path |
|---|---|
| served forecast model | `models/prophet_baseline_v1_0_shipped.pkl` |
| served forecast metrics | `data/processed/prophet_metrics_baseline_v1_0.json` |
| served backtest rows | `data/processed/prophet_backtest_rows_baseline_v1_0.parquet` |
| served shortfall model | `models/shortfall_classifier_v1.pkl` |
| training scratch (never served) | `models/prophet_baseline_v1.pkl` |

Models load once in the FastAPI lifespan handler and live in `app.state`.

## 1. `GET /production/history`

Monthly MH+MP manganese production from the IBM MSMP bulletins.

**Query params**

| name | type | default | rules |
|---|---|---|---|
| `start` | string `YYYY-MM` | `null` (series start) | must parse as a month; `422` otherwise |
| `end` | string `YYYY-MM` | `null` (series end) | must parse; must be `>= start` or `422` |

**Response `200`**

```json
{
  "series": [
    {
      "report_month": "2026-05",
      "mh_qty_tonnes": 106289.75,
      "mp_qty_tonnes": 108334.53,
      "mh_plus_mp_qty_tonnes": 214624.28,
      "all_india_qty_tonnes": 439949.424,
      "extraction_method": "text"
    }
  ],
  "coverage": {
    "months_present": 123,
    "months_missing": 2,
    "date_range": {"start": "2016-01", "end": "2026-05"},
    "gaps": ["2016-03", "2023-03"]
  },
  "metadata": {
    "source": "IBM MSMP monthly bulletins",
    "proxy_note": "MH+MP is used as proxy for MOIL operating region (~49% of India's manganese)"
  }
}
```

`extraction_method` is `"text"` or `"ocr"`. Five months are `"ocr"`
(2020-07, 2024-09, 2025-02, 2025-05, 2025-10); the frontend may badge them.

> **Note:** `coverage` is scoped to the query window. `months_missing`,
> `date_range`, and `gaps` all describe the filtered response, not the
> underlying series. To get global series health, call with no params.

```bash
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/production/history?start=2024-01&end=2026-05"
```

---

## 2. `GET /mines`

The ten MOIL operating mines.

**Query params**

| name | type | default | rules |
|---|---|---|---|
| `state` | string | `null` | `MH` or `MP`; anything else `422` |
| `mine_type` | string | `null` | `underground`, `opencast`, `mixed`; else `422` |

**Response `200`**

```json
{
  "mines": [
    {
      "mine_name": "Balaghat",
      "state": "MP",
      "district": "Balaghat",
      "mine_type": "underground",
      "equipment": ["SDL", "rocker_shovel", "shaft_sinking_rig"],
      "capacity_target_tonnes": 800000,
      "notes": "Company's largest mine; described as the deepest underground manganese mine in Asia...",
      "sources": [
        {"tag": "IBM_2022", "url": "https://ibm.gov.in/writereaddata/files/17125770456613da1576db0Manganese_Ore_2022.pdf"}
      ],
      "type_note": null
    }
  ],
  "counts": {
    "total": 10, "underground": 7, "opencast": 3, "mixed": 0,
    "MH": 6, "MP": 4,
    "with_capacity_target": 3,
    "with_generic_fleet_only": 4
  }
}
```

`capacity_target_tonnes` is `null` for seven of ten mines — only Balaghat
(800000), Gumgaon (350000) and Kandri (100000) disclose a numeric target.
`type_note` is non-null **only for Kandri**; the frontend should treat it as
optional and render it as a tooltip where present.

Districts for the six Maharashtra mines are inferred from general geography,
not source-cited — do not present them as sourced facts.

```bash
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/mines?state=MP"
```

---

## 3. `GET /mines/{mine_name}`

**Path param:** `mine_name`, case-sensitive, must match a key exactly
(`Balaghat`, `Ukwa`, `Sitapatore`, `Tirodi`, `Gumgaon`, `Kandri`, `Munsar`,
`Beldongri`, `Chikla`, `Dongri Buzurg`). URL-encode the space in
`Dongri%20Buzurg`.

**Response `200`** — a single mine object as above, plus the fleet vocabulary
so the frontend can render generic fallbacks:

```json
{
  "mine_name": "Kandri",
  "state": "MH",
  "district": "Nagpur",
  "mine_type": "underground",
  "type_note": "Company classification underground; EC summary suggests mixed opencast/underground component",
  "equipment": ["dumper_20_to_25t", "water_tanker_sprinkler", "hydraulic_sand_stowing", "shaft_sinking_rig"],
  "capacity_target_tonnes": 100000,
  "notes": "Expansion proposal 0.063 MTPA to 0.100 MTPA...",
  "sources": [
    {"tag": "IBM_2020", "url": "https://ibm.gov.in/writereaddata/files/04272022163406Manganese_2020.pdf"},
    {"tag": "MPCB_KANDRI_EC", "url": "https://mpcb.ecmpcb.in/notices/pdf/kandri.pdf"}
  ],
  "fleet_vocabulary": {
    "applicable": ["SDL", "rocker_shovel", "electro_hydrostatic_drill", "hydraulic_sand_stowing", "shaft_sinking_rig", "rock_mechanics_monitoring"],
    "is_generic_fallback": false
  }
}
```

`is_generic_fallback` is `true` for the four mines whose `equipment` is a
placeholder (`Munsar`, `Beldongri`, `Sitapatore`, `Dongri Buzurg`),
signalling that no mine-specific fleet was disclosed with sufficient detail.

> **Dongri Buzurg footnote:** its source mentions equipment (excavator,
> dumper) but gives no capacity. Following the same source-caution as the
> other generic-fleet mines, we do not tag a specific dumper capacity we
> cannot verify.

**`404`** for an unknown mine:

```json
{"detail": "mine 'Foo' not found. Known mines: Balaghat, Beldongri, Chikla, ..."}
```

```bash
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/mines/Dongri%20Buzurg"
```

---

## 4. `GET /forecast`

Prophet forecast of MH+MP production.

**Query params**

| name | type | default | rules |
|---|---|---|---|
| `horizon` | int | `1` | one of `1, 3, 6, 12`; else `422` |

**Response `200`**

```json
{
  "forecast_date": "2026-09-09",
  "target_period": "2026-06",
  "horizon_months": 1,
  "predicted_tonnes": 201283.82,
  "predicted_lower_ci": 176_000.0,
  "predicted_upper_ci": 226_000.0,
  "ci_level": 0.80,
  "components": {"trend": 198500.0, "yearly": 0.014, "multiplicative_terms": 0.014},
  "model": {
    "version": "prophet_baseline_v1.0",
    "variant": "vanilla",
    "regressors": [],
    "trained_through": "2026-05",
    "changepoint_prior_scale": 0.25,
    "mcmc_samples": 300
  },
  "accuracy_at_horizon": {
    "mape": 10.93,
    "naive_mape": 9.67,
    "skill_vs_naive_pp": -1.26,
    "ci80_coverage": 64.0,
    "n_origins": 25
  }
}
```

`components` keys vary with the fitted model; the shipped vanilla variant has
**no rainfall or capex component**, so the frontend must iterate whatever keys
arrive rather than indexing fixed names.

`accuracy_at_horizon` is the backtest row for the requested horizon, so the UI
can show honest error bars. **`skill_vs_naive_pp` is negative at horizons 1, 3
and 6** — the model loses to seasonal-naive there and only wins at 12
(`+0.24`). That is a real property of the series, and the frontend should not
present the forecast as beating a naive benchmark at short horizons.

`ci80_coverage` is 60–71%, below the nominal 80%. Intervals are known to be
too tight; recalibration is open work.

```bash
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/forecast?horizon=12"
```

---

## 5. `GET /forecast/history`

Backtest metrics per horizon for the shipped model.

**No query params.**

**Response `200`**

```json
{
  "horizons": [
    {"horizon_months": 1, "n_origins": 25, "mape": 10.93, "rmse": 25320.0,
     "naive_mape": 9.67, "skill_vs_naive_pp": -1.26, "ci80_coverage": 64.0},
    {"horizon_months": 12, "n_origins": 14, "mape": 9.92, "rmse": 25948.0,
     "naive_mape": 10.16, "skill_vs_naive_pp": 0.24, "ci80_coverage": 71.4}
  ],
  "origins": [
    {"horizon_months": 1, "origin_month": "2024-05", "target_month": "2024-06",
     "actual_tonnes": 150644.0, "predicted_tonnes": 158200.0, "covered": true}
  ],
  "model": {"version": "prophet_baseline_v1.0", "variant": "vanilla"},
  "benchmark": {"name": "seasonal_naive", "definition": "same calendar month one year earlier"}
}
```

`origins` is the per-origin detail (82 rows across four horizons) for plotting
actual-vs-predicted. If the frontend only needs the summary, read `horizons`.

```bash
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/forecast/history"
```

---

## 6. `GET /shortfall/risk`

Probability that next month's production falls below 90% of the Prophet
forecast, with a SHAP explanation.

**No query params.** The endpoint always scores the next unobserved month.

Schema below is derived from the shipped `shortfall_classifier_v1.pkl` and the
real 2026-06 prediction, not from the retired scaffold's schema.

**Response `200`**

```json
{
  "as_of": "2026-05",
  "forecast_month": "2026-06",
  "shortfall_probability": 0.1073,
  "risk_level": "low",
  "shortfall_definition": "actual production below 90% of the Prophet forecast for that month",
  "prophet_forecast_tonnes": 201283.82,
  "shortfall_threshold_tonnes": 181155.44,
  "feature_contributions": [
    {
      "feature_name": "deviation_lag1",
      "human_label": "Last month vs forecast",
      "value": 0.074,
      "display_value": "+7.4%",
      "shap_contribution": -1.5043,
      "direction": "decreases_risk"
    },
    {
      "feature_name": "prophet_forecast_level",
      "human_label": "Forecast production level",
      "value": 201283.82,
      "display_value": "201,284 t",
      "shap_contribution": -1.1578,
      "direction": "decreases_risk"
    },
    {
      "feature_name": "rainfall_lag2_mm",
      "human_label": "Rainfall 2 months ago",
      "value": 1.5,
      "display_value": "1.5 mm",
      "shap_contribution": 1.0273,
      "direction": "increases_risk"
    },
    {
      "feature_name": "production_trend_3mo",
      "human_label": "3-month production trend",
      "value": 1.117,
      "display_value": "+11.7% vs prior quarter",
      "shap_contribution": -0.4871,
      "direction": "decreases_risk"
    },
    {
      "feature_name": "rainfall_lag1_mm",
      "human_label": "Rainfall last month",
      "value": 3.968,
      "display_value": "4.0 mm",
      "shap_contribution": 0.3199,
      "direction": "increases_risk"
    }
  ],
  "shap_base_value": -0.0128,
  "feature_provenance": {
    "rainfall": "observed",
    "prophet_forecast": "shipped_model"
  },
  "model_metadata": {
    "version": "shortfall_classifier_v1",
    "base_rate": 0.217,
    "roc_auc": 0.749,
    "pr_auc": 0.344,
    "trained_on_months": 60,
    "trained_on_positives": 13,
    "decision_threshold": 0.5
  }
}
```

`feature_contributions` returns **all nine features**, sorted by
`|shap_contribution|` descending. The API does not decide how many the UI
shows - the frontend slices. Nine items is a negligible payload difference
and avoids baking a display choice into the contract. `shap_contribution`
is in log-odds; `shap_base_value + sum(all nine contributions)` passes through
a sigmoid to `shortfall_probability` exactly, so the frontend can show a
waterfall that reconciles.

`risk_level` thresholds on probability: `low < 0.25`, `medium 0.25–0.50`,
`high >= 0.50`.

`feature_provenance` is keyed by concern so it can grow without a breaking
change. `rainfall` is `"observed"` or `"imputed_climatology"`;
`prophet_forecast` is `"shipped_model"` or `"scratch_model"`. It
exists because a silent climatology fallback produced a false null in Phase
3.2c; if it ever reads `imputed_climatology`, the explanation is weaker and
the UI should say so.

**Honest-framing fields the UI should surface:** the model was trained on 60
months with 13 positives, and COVID-scale shocks are absent from that window.
It is a screening tool (precision 0.33, recall 0.71), not a prediction.

```bash
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/shortfall/risk"
```

---

## 7. `GET /dashboard/summary`

One call for the landing view; composes the endpoints above.

**No query params.**

**Response `200`**

```json
{
  "generated_at": "2026-09-09T14:20:00Z",
  "latest_actual": {"month": "2026-05", "mh_plus_mp_tonnes": 214624.28, "all_india_tonnes": 439949.424},
  "next_forecast": {
    "month": "2026-06", "predicted_tonnes": 201283.82,
    "lower_ci": 176000.0, "upper_ci": 226000.0, "ci_level": 0.80
  },
  "shortfall": {"month": "2026-06", "probability": 0.1073, "risk_level": "low"},
  "series_health": {
    "months_present": 123, "months_missing": 2,
    "date_range": {"start": "2016-01", "end": "2026-05"},
    "ocr_recovered_months": 5
  },
  "model_health": {
    "forecast_version": "prophet_baseline_v1.0",
    "shortfall_version": "shortfall_classifier_v1",
    "best_horizon": {"horizon_months": 12, "mape": 9.92, "skill_vs_naive_pp": 0.24}
  },
  "mines": {"total": 10, "underground": 7, "opencast": 3}
}
```

If a component fails to load, its block is `null` and the rest still returns
`200` — a broken shortfall model must not blank the whole landing page. The
key itself is always present: a missing key and a null key behave differently
in a TypeScript client.

`degraded` is always present in the response. In the happy case it's an empty
array `[]`. When component endpoints fail, it contains their names (e.g.
`["shortfall"]`). Frontends can rely on the field always being an array and
check length > 0 for degradation state.

```json
{"shortfall": null, "degraded": ["shortfall"]}
```

```bash
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/dashboard/summary"
```

---

## 8. `GET /recommendations`

**Contract only — the rules engine is Bucket 2.** Until then the endpoint
returns `501` with `{"error_code": "not_implemented", "detail": "..."}`, so
the frontend can mock against the shape without a fake success.

**Query params**

| name | type | default | rules |
|---|---|---|---|
| `mine_name` | string | `null` | must match a known mine; else `422` |
| `limit` | int | `5` | 1–20; else `422` |

**Response `200` (once implemented)**

```json
{
  "generated_at": "2026-09-09T14:20:00Z",
  "context": {
    "mine_name": "Balaghat",
    "mine_type": "underground",
    "shortfall_probability": 0.1073,
    "forecast_month": "2026-06"
  },
  "recommendations": [
    {
      "id": "ug_stowing_capacity",
      "title": "Review hydraulic sand stowing capacity ahead of monsoon",
      "rationale": "Rainfall two months prior is the strongest rainfall signal in the shortfall model; stowing throughput constrains face availability after wet periods.",
      "equipment_referenced": ["hydraulic_sand_stowing"],
      "triggered_by": [
        {"signal": "rainfall_lag2_mm", "value": 1.5, "shap_contribution": 1.0273}
      ],
      "priority": "medium",
      "confidence": "rule_based"
    }
  ]
}
```

`equipment_referenced` items must come from `UNDERGROUND_FLEET_VOCAB` or
`OPENCAST_FLEET_VOCAB`. Public sources record no LHD, jumbo drill or
100-tonne dumper at any MOIL mine, so generic mining terminology would name
equipment MOIL does not operate.

`confidence` is `rule_based` — these are deterministic rules, not model output,
and the UI should not imply a learned confidence score.

```bash
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/recommendations?mine_name=Balaghat&limit=3"
```

---

## 9. `POST /forecast/retrain`

**Demo mode: stubbed.** Returns `501`:

```json
{
  "error_code": "not_implemented",
  "detail": "retraining is disabled in demo mode",
  "remedy": "run python -m src.models.forecast.prophet_baseline locally, then promote the artifact"
}
```

Retraining takes roughly 40 minutes with MCMC sampling, cannot be
meaningfully awaited in a demo, and the previous implementation wrote to the
served model path — the exact mechanism that put the rejected rainfall variant
into production. The existing `GET /forecast/retrain/{task_id}` stays for
shape compatibility and reports `404` for unknown ids.

---

## 10. `GET /prospectivity/heatmap`

Gridded prospectivity scores for the map view.

This endpoint exists because `POST /predict/bbox` cannot feed a map: it
returns a score-sorted list whose cells do not lie on a lattice, and which
includes cells outside the requested bbox. See `docs/known_issues.md`.
Phase 2 is frozen, so this routes around it rather than fixing it.

**Query params**

| name | type | default | rules |
|---|---|---|---|
| `min_lon` | float | required | -180..180; `< max_lon` else `422` |
| `min_lat` | float | required | -90..90; `< max_lat` else `422` |
| `max_lon` | float | required | -180..180 |
| `max_lat` | float | required | -90..90 |
| `grid_size` | int | `32` | cells per side, 8..128; else `422` |
| `mask` | string | `none` | `none`, `geological`, `occurrence_buffer`, `both`; else `422` |

`mask` uses the **same vocabulary as `/predict/point` and `/predict/bbox`**
(`VALID_MASKS`), so one enum covers every prospectivity endpoint.

`grid_size` is cells per side rather than a distance, so the client controls
payload size directly. Non-square bboxes give non-square cells; the response
reports the actual `cell_width_deg` and `cell_height_deg` it used.

**Response `200`**

```json
{
  "bbox": [79.53, 21.32, 80.57, 22.05],
  "grid": {
    "n_cols": 32,
    "n_rows": 32,
    "cell_width_deg": 0.0325,
    "cell_height_deg": 0.0228,
    "origin": "top_left"
  },
  "scores": [[0.12, 0.31, null, "..."], ["..."]],
  "cells": {
    "cells_total": 1024,
    "cells_outside_raster": 118,
    "cells_masked_out": 240,
    "cells_scored": 666
  },
  "score_range": {"min": 0.001, "max": 0.99, "cap": 0.99},
  "mask_applied": "none",
  "model_version": "prospectivity_v6",
  "generated_at": "2026-09-09T14:20:00Z",
  "cached": true
}
```

`scores` is row-major, `n_rows` arrays of `n_cols` floats, aligned exactly to
the requested bbox with `origin: "top_left"` so it drops onto a Leaflet or
MapLibre image overlay without flipping.

**`null` means no data, and is distinct from `0.0`.** A cell is `null` when it
falls outside the imagery footprint **or** when every feature extracted for it
is null. The second case matters: `/predict/point` currently returns the
capped score `0.990` for such cells, so Kandri and Beldongri - both just
outside the footprint - score as maximum prospectivity on no data at all. A
heatmap that rendered those would put its two brightest hotspots where nothing
was measured. See `docs/known_issues.md`.

### Cell states — how to render each

`scores` cells take exactly four states. Conflating the first two would
misreport absence of data as absence of prospectivity.

| state | meaning | render as |
|---|---|---|
| `null` | **no data** — outside the imagery footprint, or every feature for the cell was null | transparent, or a "no data" hatch. **Never** the bottom of the colour scale. |
| `0.0` | a genuine low score, **or** a cell a mask excluded | bottom of the colour scale |
| `0.0 < s <= 0.99` | a real score | on the colour scale |
| `> 0.99` | cannot occur — scores are capped | n/a; legend maximum should read **"≥ 0.99"**, not `1.0` |

`cells_masked_out` counts cells a mask zeroed; those are returned as `0.0`,
not `null`, because "excluded by geology" is a finding, not missing data.

**Colour-ramp note:** under the promoted v6 bundle, roughly **24.5% of cells
score at or above 0.90**. A linear 0–0.99 ramp will render about a quarter of
the map at maximum intensity. A percentile-based or non-linear ramp separates
the top of the distribution far better.

`score_range.cap` surfaces the 0.99 ceiling so the legend does not imply a
true 1.0 maximum.

### Performance

**This endpoint's SLA is deliberately different from the rest of the API:
5 s warm / 45 s cold. Startup pre-warming for the three configured viewports
means the demo never hits a cold path; the cold number is documented for
completeness only.** It is not held to the 500 ms target that applies to
`/forecast` and `/shortfall/risk`, because it scores up to 16,384 cells with
per-cell feature extraction.

Caching:

- key is `(bbox rounded to 4dp, grid_size, mask, model_version)` - the model
  version is in the key so a hotfixed model cannot serve stale tiles
- persisted to `data/cache/heatmap_{hash}.json`, 24-hour TTL
- warming runs asynchronously on API startup for the viewports in
  `settings.HEATMAP_WARM_VIEWPORTS`. The API is available immediately; warming
  completes in the background (~2 minutes for three viewports) and populates
  the cache before the demo would realistically first hit it. Warming failures
  log a warning but don't block startup. The viewports are:
  `full_bbox` `[79.0, 21.3, 80.6, 22.1]`, `balaghat_bhandara`
  `[79.53, 21.32, 80.57, 22.05]`, `balaghat_ukwa` `[80.05, 21.70, 80.60, 22.05]`
  — all at `grid_size=32`, and all fully inside the usable raster footprint,
  so none contain null cells
- `cached: true` in the response tells the client it was a cache hit

```bash
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/prospectivity/heatmap?min_lon=79.53&min_lat=21.32&max_lon=80.57&max_lat=22.05&grid_size=32&mask=none"
```

## CORS

Allowed origins: `http://localhost:3000`, `http://localhost:5173`,
`http://localhost:8080`, plus `127.0.0.1` equivalents. No production origin is
configured; adding one needs an explicit decision.

## Logging

Every request logs `method`, `path`, `status`, `elapsed_ms`.

## Performance

`/forecast` and `/shortfall/risk` target < 500 ms. Models load once at startup
into `app.state`; per-request cost is prediction only. `/forecast` at
`horizon=12` builds a 12-row future frame and is the slowest path.
