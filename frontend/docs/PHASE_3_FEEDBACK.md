# Phase 3 — Feedback Hub UI

Implemented only /feedback. Other nine routes, lib/api and lib/contracts.ts are unchanged (21 protected-file fingerprints verified).

## Components

- components/feedback/FeedbackHub.tsx: client state, two-column desktop / stacked mobile composition and explicit map placeholder.
- AnnotationForm.tsx: manual Site ID (optional initialSiteId prop for later integration), annotation type, severity and notes. Required fields, whitespace validation, length limits, associated error messages, clear action and local submission.
- PendingAnnotationsTable.tsx: all six requested columns, severity badges, UTC dates, monospaced IDs, expandable notes and keyboard-scrollable overflow container.
- demo-annotations.ts: four explicitly synthetic examples, spanning every type/severity and Pending/Reviewed states. New entries are marked Local only. No backend API contract was invented.
- types.ts: local presentation types only.
- components/ui/select.tsx and textarea.tsx: new token-based native primitives. No dependency added.

## Honesty and behavior

The map is not integrated. IDs and geographic scope are not validated. Submissions only update React state and are lost when the page unmounts or reloads. The UI explicitly states that nothing is sent to review or retraining. User-provided site names are not inferred. Reviewed example status does not assert assay results, verified labels or completed training. Backend persistence, reviewer permissions and retraining remain future integration work.

## Verification

- TypeScript and isolated production build passed; all ten routes compile.
- All 15 unit tests and six existing Playwright regression tests passed in Chrome. Regression mode uses existing fixtures, not live backend verification.
- Browser checks passed: required fields, whitespace rejection, successful row addition, severity/type values, accessible success message, clear form, notes disclosure, 390px page overflow check and reload reset.
- Desktop visual review at 1920x1080 and mobile at 390x844. The annotation table scrolls inside its container on narrow screens.

Stopped for approval. No additional enterprise pages or backend integrations were built.
