/** Adapter for GET /prospectivity/heatmap.

 * The backend returns a row-major score LATTICE; the map consumes a GeoJSON
 * FeatureCollection of polygons. This converts one to the other while keeping
 * the distinction the whole map depends on:
 *
 *   null  -> NO DATA (outside the imagery footprint, or every feature null).
 *            Emitted as `final_score: null`, which the committed layer filter
 *            `["==",["typeof",["get","final_score"]],"number"]` drops entirely,
 *            so it never lands on the colour ramp. Never coerce this to 0.
 *   0.0   -> a real finding: a genuine low score, or a cell a mask zeroed.
 *            Renders at the bottom of the ramp.
