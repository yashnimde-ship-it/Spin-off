/** Adapter for GET /mines, scored through POST /predict/point.

 * Pattern matched from lib/api/forecast.ts and lib/api/predictions.ts: raw
 * backend shapes stay in wire.ts, the schema the UI renders from lives in
 * lib/contracts.ts, and this module maps between the two. A response that
 * cannot be mapped raises ContractMismatchError rather than being padded.
 *
 * The roster and the scores come from two different endpoints: /mines carries
 * the cited coordinate and its confidence, /predict/point carries the model's
 * read of that coordinate. They are fetched together so a card cannot show a
 * score without the provenance of the point it was taken at.
